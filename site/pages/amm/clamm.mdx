# clAMM

The **Concentrated Liquidity Automated Market Maker (clAMM)** allows liquidity providers to focus their capital within specific price ranges rather than across the entire price curve. This enables more efficient use of liquidity, reducing slippage for trades within those ranges, and increasing the potential fee earnings for liquidity providers. Uniswap V3 introduced this model, allowing liquidity providers to have better control over their positions.
