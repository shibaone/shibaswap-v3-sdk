# cpAMM

The **Constant Product Automated Market Maker (cpAMM)** uses a simple formula: x * y = k, where x and y represent the reserves of two assets, and k is a constant. This ensures that the product of the two asset reserves always remains the same. Itâ€™s the most widely used AMM model, popularized by Uniswap V2. The cpAMM provides liquidity for any price point, though with higher slippage for large trades, particularly for volatile or low-liquidity pairs.
