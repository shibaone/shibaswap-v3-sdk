# cpAMM

The **Liquidity Book Automated Market Maker (lbAMM)** is a more advanced AMM model that divides liquidity into "bins," each corresponding to a specific price range. This allows for more granular liquidity management, ensuring minimal slippage as trades happen within each price bin. Liquidity providers can select specific price bins, offering more control over liquidity placement. This structure helps reduce impermanent loss and increases capital efficiency, making it ideal for volatile or unevenly distributed assets. This approach was introduced by Trader Joe on the Avalanche network.
