# Sushi

Below is a list of Sushi token addresses across each chain where it is deployed. 

On some chains, Sushi tokens are considered insolvent due to the bridges that they were issued through being hacked or becoming defunct. This applies particularly to anySushi from the Multchain/AnySwap bridge and 1Sushi from the Harmony v1 bridge.
