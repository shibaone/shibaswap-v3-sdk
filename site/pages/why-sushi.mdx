# üç£ Why Sushi

Sushi (SushiSwap) stands out as a versatile, community-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that offers more than just token swaps. Launched in 2020, Sushi quickly gained traction by combining competitive yields, governance features, and innovative products. Here‚Äôs a quick look at why DeFi enthusiasts choose Sushi:

## All-in-One Ecosystem

Sushi isn‚Äôt just an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for swapping tokens. It also features a powerful aggregator tool to secure the best prices from various decentralized exchanges, eliminating the hassle of manually searching for optimal trades.

## Rewarding Liquidity Providers

By supplying liquidity to Sushi pools, providers earn a portion of the trading fees‚Äîplus potential SUSHI token rewards in special farms. This dual mechanism of fee sharing and token rewards makes liquidity provisioning on Sushi attractive.

## Governance & Community

Sushi‚Äôs governance token, SUSHI, allows holders to vote on protocol changes and developmental directions, fostering a strong community-driven environment. Staking SUSHI into xSUSHI further grants holders a share of the platform‚Äôs fees.
